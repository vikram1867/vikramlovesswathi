    <h1>Happy Valentine's Day Swathi <3</h1>
	
    <p>I've been waiting for this day to come. </p>
    <p>I think that we complement each other really well. Peanut Butter & Jelly, Awesomeness & Lamborghini, Land & Sea, Vikram & Swathi. It just works  (unlike pineapples on pizza… sorry not sorry babe). <br> I love you for your intelligence, kindness, voice, smile, and laugh, and I love getting lost in your eyes. I still freeze up looking at you. I think the goddesses in the heavens were seriously locked in when they created you. You’re so beautiful. <br> Swathi, we’ve established that there are a lot of things I love about you but, one of the most attractive things about you is the way you explain complex concepts to me in a way I can easily understand. Like the P53 gene, how it stops tumors and cancer, and the role of white blood cells. As a business major, I never thought I’d ever learn that. This is what happens when you deviate from the coloring books in our syllabuses. Anyhow, there’s a gleam in your eye when you talk about something you’re passionate about and it’s so beautiful to me. I promise I will try my hardest to support you as you achieve your dreams and ambitions. <br> The person who came up with the saying head-over-heels in love probably felt the exact same way I do whenever I think of your name. <br> Swathi, even your name is beautiful. I wish you knew how much I love you. <br> Happy Valentine's Day darling. </p>


    <p>Love, <br> Vikram Guruswamy </p>
